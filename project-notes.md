### Project Note:
- Created the plugin based on my personal plugin boilerplate, but of course I can work with any other standards based on company's policy.
- I assume the client runs PHP >= 5.4, of course >= 7.0 is highly recommended
- I assume the whole project should be self-contained, so I didn't add any dependencies like Advanced Custom Fields plugin which should provide more flexibility and less effort
